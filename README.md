## Project Background 
"Cleaning data is my favorite part of the data science process"...said no data scientist ever. 


The ultimate goal of the data science process is to help stakeholders uncover insights within a dataset to help them make sound 
decisions for their organization. To do this we would need clean data. No, I'm not talking about grabbing some windex and 
wiping it down with a towel. As any data scientist can attest to, there is no such thing as a clean dataset right off the bat. That is why we have to clean the data. This includes identifying outliers, filling in/removing missing values, among others.
